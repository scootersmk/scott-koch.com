Title: Open Source Software
Date: 2018-01-28 12:48


Having been a Linux/Unix systems administrator my entire career I
have benefitted heavily from free and open source software. Therefore,
I have always felt its important for me to make contributions when
I can to give back to the community. What follows is a list of some
of my contributions big and small that I have worked on over the
years. I hope I can continue to find time to keep adding to this
list.
